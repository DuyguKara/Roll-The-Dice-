# Roll-The-Dice-
This is mini website game.
In this project, my aim is learn to add javascript in my static website. So I create a mini dice game. If you click play button, roll the dices randomly. And then, player 1 or player 2 will win this game. Maybe the dice roll evenly and may result in a draw. I wrote a function to make the dice come randomly and changed my HTML element with JavaScript accordingly. Then, by adding the eventListener property to the button, I made my function run when the click event occurred. You can look at the web site in here --->  https://duygukara.github.io/Roll-The-Dice-/
